[![Build Status](http://beta.drone.io/api/badges/lgtmco/lgtm/status.svg)](http://beta.drone.io/lgtmco/lgtm)

LGTM is a simple pull request approval system using GitHub protected branches and maintainers files. Pull requests are locked and cannot be merged until the minimum number of approvals are received. Project maintainers can indicate their approval by commenting on the pull request and including LGTM (looks good to me) in their approval text. For more information please see the documentation at https://lgtm.com/docs

### Status

LGTM is actively used by thousands of repositories. The lack of commit activity in the Git repository is not an indication that the project is abandoned or inactive. The lack of activity is an indication the author views this project as being feature-complete.

### Development

LGTM is meant to be extremely simple and focused and is largely considered feature-complete. The author is certainly interested in minor improvements and bug fixes, but is not interested in major enhancements. Feel free to fork the project and extend (and even re-brand) as you see fit.

### Setup

Please see our [installation guide](https://lgtm.com/docs/install/) to install the official Docker image.

### Build

Clone the repository to your Go workspace:

```sh
git clone git://github.com/lgtmco/lgtm.git $GOPATH/src/github.com/lgtmco/lgtm
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lgtmco/lgtm
```

Commands to build from source:

```sh
export GO15VENDOREXPERIMENT=1

make deps    # Download required dependencies
make gen     # Generate code
make build   # Build the binary
```

If you are having trouble building this project please reference its .drone.yml file. Everything you need to know about building LGTM is defined in that file.
